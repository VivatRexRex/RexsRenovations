					<h2>Hi. My name is Mario!</h2>
					<p>Rex's Renovations was created by myself as a tribute to my father who has passed away. He was always a hard working man and he was always good with his hands.</p>
					<p>  I created Rex's Renovations to help those who are in need! To help bring a change of atmosphere or to simply upgrade or make simple changes to an environment to bring positive energy and to also bring peoples visions to life.</p>

			<h2>About Mario</h2>

			<p>After I graduated high school I started working in retail and quickly realized it wasn't really my passion. I have always spent most of my time in front of a computer and have always wanted to learn how to code and create websites. I became interested in taking pictures so I started studying photography, and in doing so got in contact with models who were looking to create a website for themselves. I then realized that I could combine my love of photography and coding by creating websites for models or anyone looking to create a website.</p>
			<p>Outside of collaborating with other software developers I am interested in music and take that passion with me when I code.</p>
            <p> As a student of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey as a software developer and it's been amazing. I've truly learned so much from the program. </p>
			<p>If you're looking to hire a new developer who is very team friendly, and loves to work on projects day in and day out please reach out! I would love the opportunity to collaborate with other developers on anything. I'm a student first before anything else and absolutely love working. </p>
