### Special Shoutout

I just would like to acknowledge my father Deon Nigel Graham who was a great man with a desire to make people smile. He loved to bring peoples visions to reality and although he might not have left a tangible legacy to me bringing peoples visions to reality was his legacy, and for that reason alone I shall take the baton and bring his legacy to life. I would also like to thank my wife Chanyah Holmes who has motivated me to chase my dreams and to pursue everything that my heart desires as well as supporting me on my journey with RexsRenovations.
